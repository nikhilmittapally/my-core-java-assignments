The code begins by importing the necessary classes: Scanner for input handling and TreeMap for storing contacts.
The class PhoneBook is declared, which contains the main method as the entry point of the program.
Inside the main method, a TreeMap called phoneBook is created to store the contacts. The key of the map is of type String (contact name), and the value is also of type String (phone number).

A Scanner object, scanner, is created to read input from the user.
The program prompts the user to enter contact details and adds them to the phone book using a do-while loop.
Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter the name and phone number of the contact.
The put method is used to add the contact to the phoneBook TreeMap, with the name as the key and the phone number as the value.
The user is asked if they want to add another contact. If the input is "yes" (ignoring the case), the loop continues; otherwise, it exits.

After all the contacts are added, the program displays the contacts in the phone book by iterating over the phoneBook TreeMap using a for-each loop.
The keySet method is used to retrieve a set of all the keys (contact names) in the TreeMap.
For each key (contact name), the corresponding value (phone number) is retrieved using the get method and printed to the console.

The program allows the user to search for a contact by name. It prompts the user to enter the name to search.
The user's input is stored in the searchName variable.
The get method is used to retrieve the phone number associated with the entered name from the phoneBook TreeMap. The result is stored in the searchResult variable.
If the searchResult is not null (i.e., if the contact is found in the phone book), the phone number is printed to the console. Otherwise, it indicates that the contact was
